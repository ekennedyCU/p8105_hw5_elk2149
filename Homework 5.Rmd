***Problem 1***

```{r}
birthdays = sample(1:365, 5, replace = TRUE)

repeated_bday = length(unique(birthdays)) < 5

repeated_bday
```

put this in a function

```{r}

bday_sim = function(n_room) {

    birthdays = sample(1:365, n_room, replace = TRUE)

    repeated_bday = length(unique(birthdays)) < n_room

    repeated_bday
    
}
```
